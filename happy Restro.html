          <h1>Associated with local and small farmers</h1>
          <p>
            A number of definitions have been proposed to describe both small
            farmers and small farms. Adams and Coward (1972) referred to a small
            farmer as one who had very little access to political power,
            productive assets and/or income streams within society. FAO/RAFE
            (1978) defined small farmers, small fishermen and peasants in broad
            terms, including the low-income producers of agricultural, livestock
            and aquatic products. They referred, in particular, to tenants,
            informal tenants such as share croppers, landless agricultural
            labourers and small owner-operators. Wapenham(1979) defined a small
            farmer as an agricultural producer controlling no more land than he
            can farm without the permanent employment of non-family labour.
            Steenwinkel (1979) included in his definition all people in the rural
            areas of developing countries who do not have the means to provide for
            their basic needs or are living in constant fear of losing their
            means. The key elements in all of these definitions are subsistence,
            low income and illiteracy. Small farms have been defined as household
            units that make most management decisions, control most of the farm
            labour supply and normally much of the capital as well. Since the
            family and the farm unit are the same, labour and capital expenditure
            decisions represent a choice between household and farm
            considerations. A more precise definition of small farms is that they
            are complex interrelationships between animals, crops and farming
            families, involving small land holdings and minimum resources of
            labour and capital, from which small farmers may or may not be able to
            derive a regular and adequate supply of food or an acceptable income
            and standard of living. Irrespective of the definition used, the
            important point is that Asia presents an overwhelming panorama of
            small farms with large populations of small farmers and peasants
            owning both ruminant and non-ruminant animals.
